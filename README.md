- 📂 **Automatic task categorization** by life domain
- 📈 **Smart prioritization** based on importance scoring
- 💾 **Persistent storage** with Supabase PostgreSQL
- 🌐 **Cloud deployment** via Railway
- 🔒 **Modular backend architecture** for extensibility

## 🏗 Technical Stack

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with Vite for fast development
- **Modern CSS** or Tailwind for styling
- **Web Speech API** for voice recognition
- **Fetch API** for backend communication

### Backend Stack
- **Flask** with modular blueprint architecture
- **SQLAlchemy** for database ORM
- **Flask-CORS** for cross-origin requests
- **Python 3.9+** runtime
- **spaCy** for NLP processing (Phase 3)

### Database & Deployment
- **Supabase PostgreSQL** for data persistence
- **Railway** for backend deployment
